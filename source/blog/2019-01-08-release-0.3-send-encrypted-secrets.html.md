## Send secrets safely

From listening to engineering teams, we heard a number of different cases with similar characteristics:

* Name and address of a customer [(PII)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personally_identifiable_information) shared with the support team
* API access tokens sent to an external developer
* Auto-generated SSH keys to Amazon EC2 instances shared with a freelancer
* Amazon Web Services IAM credentials for S3 access
* Temporary passwords sent to new team members
* PGP private key to a joint hello@ inbox, shared among the team
* Password to an encrypted ZIP file

These are small bits of data, fairly short lived, with the potential for high impact if lost (for example a [$50,000 Amazon bill](https://www.quora.com/My-AWS-account-was-hacked-and-I-have-a-50-000-bill-how-can-I-reduce-the-amount-I-need-to-pay))

### How to quickly share throwaway secrets?

You've got stuff to do, you need to get this thing sent, what are you going to do?

The easy route is to throw it into Slack and hope they aren't next week's big data breach.

Maybe you could use a messaging app like WhatsApp or Signal. But that requires you know your team-mate's number, which isn't the norm for many teams. And WhatsApp is determined to back itself up to Google Drive, so it'll probably end up there too.

You could use GPG, but can you remember the command? And do you have the other person's public key? And are you confident that they'll copy-paste the funny text correctly on their end?

<pre>
<span class="prompt">$</span> gpg --armor --recipient paul@fluidkeys.com --encrypt
-----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE-----

hQEMA35uuyjbagYuAQf/eqfq3MCS96ZNNQeI7S3zGs7FiAIiQ7qU5Oa1Dz6/UizC
pQnTHjoupyGChXeDz9XDdmWtTuvYArlnjdVJfySHWGDQ66mm/IUie0jsnTOss6P1
...
</pre>

You could put it in your shared password manager, but it's a bit overkill since you only need to send it once, and sometimes you see a delay on shared items showing up.

With Fluidkeys you can send PGP-encrypted secrets directly from the command-line using your team-mate's email address.

<pre class="terminal">
<span class="prompt">$</span> fk secret send paul@fluidkeys.com
</pre>

## Fluidkeys fetches public keys automatically

When you install and set up Fluidkeys, you're asked for your email address. Once you've verified it, others can send you secrets. You don't need to manually exchange public keys.

Fluidkeys automatically fetches keys based on the verified email address and encrypts the secret to the key.

<pre class="terminal">
<span class="prompt">$</span> fk secret send paul@fluidkeys.com
<span class="positive"> â–¸   Found public key for paul@paulfurley.com</span>
</pre>

## Install and set up Fluidkeys in 2 minutes

We've heard from a number of teams how time consuming it is to set up new starters with PGP and we've worked hard on this.

It takes around 2 minutes to install Fluidkeys, verify your email and start sending and receiving encrypted secrets.

<pre class="terminal">
<span class="prompt">$</span> fk setup
</pre>

## Things to be aware of

### Fluidkeys stores your keys in gpg

Beware that Fluidkeys doesn't implement its own storage of keys: it stores them in `gpg`. If you delete a key from `gpg`, there's no copy in Fluidkeys. We don't modify the `GNUPGHOME` directory: we push and pull straight from your default `gpg2` installation.

This is helpful if you use your keys for anything else like signing commits with `git` or encrypted email with Thunderbird.

Those applications will use keys made by Fluidkeys, and Fluidkeys will keep them updated.

### Fluidkeys stores your key's password in your system keychain

In order to be able to rotate your key automatically, Fluidkeys stores the password to your private key in your sysystem keychain. You can search for entries containing "Fluidkeys".

### Fluidkeys doesn't upload to the public keyserver network

We chose not to use the public keyserver network until it supports deleting keys and cryptographic validation.

If you do want to upload to the public keyservers, make sure you automate it. Because Fluidkeys automatically rotates your encryption subkey every month, your key will quickly become out of sync with the keyservers. You could add cron task to upload your key regularly:

Edit your crontab by running `crontab -e` and add this line:

```
@daily gpg --keyserver pool.sks-keyservers.net --send-key <email address>
```
