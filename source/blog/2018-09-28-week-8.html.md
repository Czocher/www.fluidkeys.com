We've got key rotation working! When you run `fk key rotate` Fluidkeys goes off and checks your PGP keys. If you’ve got one set to expire years in the future, or if one is about to imminently expire, it’ll helpfully offer to update them. It’ll set them to be valid until the end of next month, the gist of it is that you'll end up using encryption keys that rotate every month.

"Roll VT!"

A couple of weeks back we got this short and helpful bit of feedback:

> I don't want to have to do anything.

> Can't it just rotate it for me?

Yes, absolutely! Next up we'll focus on making all this magic happen in the background.

That’s it for this week.

Despite [Ryanair's best efforts](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-45667370), I'm off to Portugal for a week. So we'll both hear from Paul next time to see what he gets up to.

See you in a fortnight.
