    <h1>Week 16: Getting started with teams</h1>
    <p><strong>Protecting liberty by simplifying security</strong></p>

<p><em>Recap</em>: We&#39;re building Fluidkeys to make it easy for teams to implement great security across their organisations. We‚Äôve built a command line app that helps you make strong PGP keys and automatically rotate them. We been speaking with teams who are using PGP in their organisations and planning for trials.</p>

<p>Inspired by <a href="https://medium.com/@cassierobinson">Cassie Robinson</a>&#39;s weeknotes, this week I&#39;m going to tell you what I&#39;ve been doing, what I&#39;ve learnt and what I&#39;m celebrating.</p>

<h2>What I&#39;ve been doing...</h2>

<p>I&#39;ve been on my own again this week as Paul&#39;s on holiday. It&#39;s been a peaceful and productive. I&#39;ve spent a lot of it with my head down <a href="https://github.com/fluidkeys">coding</a> wrangling with Go and JSON. I also spoke to two people working in organisations that are using PGP and organising to speak to others. (Thanks to those of you that have put me in touch with others! üôè)</p>

<h2>What I‚Äôve learnt‚Ä¶</h2>

<p>Interesting how the two people I spoke to had quite different needs: for one, it‚Äôd be massively useful for them to simplify the way they onboard people and keep all their keys in sync. For the other, this wouldn‚Äôt be enough and they‚Äôd need a way to also send secret ‚Äòsnippets‚Äô to colleagues.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve learnt that I‚Äôm still unsure as to whether shipping something that simply improves the setup and administration of PGP is useful enough as a product in and of itself. That said, we‚Äôre nearly ready to release this, so we can experiment with finding a market for that while we build additional features on this foundation.</p>

<h2>What I‚Äôm celebrating‚Ä¶</h2>

<p>I‚Äôve got a ‚Äòteam-server‚Äô working‚Ä¶ almost.</p>

<p>Check it out!</p>

What‚Äôs your Flextech email address?

Edit and send the invite below to your team:

---
  Hello! Come and join our Flextech team on Fluidkeys
  Download Fluidkeys from download.fluidkeys.com then run:
  > fk team join aeab4301-3084-4156-bf97-bbaa9d17cf3a
---

You‚Äôll need to approve new team members by running:

> fk team approve

<span class="prompt">‚ûú</span>  <span class="directory">~</span>
</pre>

<p>I say almost as I&#39;ve not quite finished wiring up the approval command, but the rest is there. People can create new teams, then team members can request to join those teams.</p>

<p>It&#39;s worth celebrating as I&#39;ve really enjoyed having a chance to write a webserver in Go. I&#39;ve also enjoyed taking time over the code such that I hope it&#39;s easy enough for Paul to jump in when he gets back next week. </p>

<p>Until then!</p>
