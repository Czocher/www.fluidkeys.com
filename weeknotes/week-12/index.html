    <h1>Week 12: Fluidkeys v0.2 and the OpenPGP Email summit</h1>
    <p><em>Recap</em>: we&#39;re building a product that makes it easy for software teams to
implement great security across their organisations. Weâ€™re currently coding a
command line application that&#39;ll be a foundation for further functionality.</p>

<h2>This week</h2>

<p>This week has been incredible and exhausting. At the weekend I was at the
 <a href="https://blog.mailfence.com/openpgp-email-summit/">OpenPGP Email Summit</a> in
Brussels, and right now I&#39;m on my way to MozFest in London.</p>

<p>Midweek, I joined Ian in Sheffield where we hit a major milestone: we released Fluidkeys v0.2!</p>

<h2>Ian led a UI crit</h2>

<p>In Wednesday Ian pulled us through an extremely thorough review of <em>every</em> bit of content in Fluidkeys.</p>

<p>Looking at everything in one place with fresh eyes was illuminating. We re-wrote loads of things and created a collection of design patterns and nomenclature. Things like, Fluidkeys <em>makes a backup</em> rather than Fluidkeys <em>backs up</em>. It&#39;s amazing how many different ways we were talking about the same things. After the crit Fluidkeys is feeling a lot more consistent and clear.</p>

<h2>We released v0.2</h2>

<p>It&#39;s been a long time coming, but we did it. This version of Fluidkeys can create, import and automatically maintain and rotate PGP keys.</p>

<p>I&#39;m delighted with it. Take a look at the <a href="/blog/release-0-2/">the release notes</a>, including a very cool terminal animation Ian knocked up.</p>

<h2>Observations from the OpenPGP summit</h2>

<p>It was an absolute pleasure to catch up with others from the community in Brussels. It was non-stop thinking, chatting, learning, hacking and socialising. It was also an incredibly warm and friendly scene which is lovely to see.</p>

<p>While it&#39;s still fresh, I&#39;m going to use this weeknote to jot down some thoughts from the summit.</p>

<h2>Usability is top of the agenda</h2>

<p>My favourite quote from the weekend was:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The threat model for email encryption is that no-one uses it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s absolutely clear that most people acknowledge that past approaches have failed: only a few million people worldwide use email encryption.</p>

<p>The old idea that you need to deeply understand cryptography in order to use has been scrapped. People are thinking hard how to hide and automate everything.</p>

<p>This is <em>great news.</em></p>

<h2>Autocrypt looks more promising than ever</h2>

<p><a href="https://autocrypt.org/">Autocrypt</a> is a set of guidelines that describes how mail programmes can <em>automatically</em> negotiate encryption with other email contacts.</p>

<p>It&#39;s mind-blowing to see two Autocrypt-enabled mail clients transparently discover keys and start encrypting. This is exactly how it should be.</p>

<p>Another great quote from Autocrypt&#39;s design principles:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Don&#39;t talk about keys. Ever.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yep.</p>

<h2>Automatic key discovery is where it&#39;s at</h2>

<p>Key discovery means finding a public key from an email address.</p>

<p>Autocrypt achieves this by embedding keys in the header of outgoing emails.</p>

<p>Additional discovery mechanisms are emerging. <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-koch-openpgp-webkey-service-06">Web Key Directory (WKD)</a> uses the <code>/.well-known/openpgpkey</code> directory over HTTPS. If a client has an email address, they map it to a specific URL, and request that URL for a key.</p>

<p>We <a href="https://github.com/fluidkeys/web-key-directory">implemented this today</a> using a Github repository as the backend.</p>

<p>WKD has some issues and the documentation is challenging, but it&#39;s a great concept. We sent out our release note with a <code>reply-to</code> header pointing to <code>hello@fluidkeys.com</code>. Any WKD-enabled mail client will automatically find the key and use it to encrypt to us.</p>

<p>(The git-repo concept won&#39;t scale since we&#39;re rotating keys every month. Fluidkeys will publish to WKD automatically, sooner or later...)</p>

<h2>OpenPGP is finally bigger than GnuPG</h2>

<p>I found it great to see the OpenPGP standard actually being used <em>as a standard</em>, with multiple implementations talking the same language.</p>

<p>It used to feel like OpenPGP meant GnuPG. That meant applications bundling a binary of gpg then calling it via its command-line interface.</p>

<p>There&#39;s still plenty of that, but some decent first-class implementations have emerged too:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://openpgpjs.org/">OpenPGP.js</a></li>
<li><a href="https://sequoia-pgp.org/">Sequoia</a>, a new Rust implemtation</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/golang/crypto/">golang/crypto</a> (ProtonMail maintain a <a href="https://github.com/protonmail/crypto">significant fork</a>)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Delta chat is my favourite new app</h2>

<p><a href="#">Delta chat</a> looks just like your favorite messaging app, but it <em>sends messages via email</em>. I didn&#39;t get why this was a big deal initially until I started using it.</p>

<p>I find it strangely delightful that everything&#39;s an email. There&#39;s no centralised service snooping on my contacts. It&#39;s difficult for censors to block it (other than blocking email itself, with the collateral damage that involves)</p>

<p>Delta chat has a cunning (experimental?) feature where you can scan a special QR code, and somehow you get a throwaway email account, and the app seamlessly logs in to it. I think it does some key exchange, and perhaps joins a chat group too (not sure on the detail here).</p>

<p>I can imagine this being useful for events like the <a href="https://internetfreedomfestival.org">Internet Freedom Festival.</a> Participants could scan a barcode on the door and have a super-secure, anonymous chat group while they&#39;re at the event. Afterwards, the accounts could be thrown away.</p>

<h2>The keyserver network needs some love</h2>

<p>The public keyserver network is run by a group of volunteers mostly using software called <a href="https://bitbucket.org/skskeyserver/sks-keyserver">SKS</a>.</p>

<p>Keyservers are used to fetch updates for keys, for example new subkeys and revocation signatures.</p>

<p>(They&#39;re also widely used for key <em>discovery</em> from an email address, but this is less than ideal since there&#39;s no validation of email addresses.)</p>

<p>In recent months the cracks began to show when a researcher uploaded a specially crafted key which broke many SKS instances.</p>

<p>SKS is written in the obscure language OCaml, using the obscure source control system mercurial, and an extremely obscure key reconciliation protocol descibed in pages of mathspeak.</p>

<p>All this obscurity means no-one is confident to make any major changes to SKS. And so it remains broken.</p>

<p>The result to end-users is that key lookups can hang and time-out, giving an overall bad impression of the software and email encryption in general.</p>

<h2>Most of us want to simplify the standard</h2>

<p>On the second day of the summit a number of us got together to discuss how to slash the standard.</p>

<p>The standard is enormous. There are multiple ways of doing the same thing and way too many choices of algorithms. Why do we need AES192 when we&#39;ve got AES256? This bloat makes it difficult for new people to enter the community and it&#39;s extremely daunting to build a new implementation.</p>

<p>A number of us agreed a strategy for dropping the cruft over time. We started defining what &quot;simplified openpgp&quot; would look like, and we&#39;ll commit to <em>only</em> outputting data within that subset. Over time, we&#39;ll be able to measure how many times obsolete features are used and make an informed decision when to remove it altogether.</p>

<p>The outstanding issue with dropping obsolute features <em>completely</em> is being able to decrypt old email archives. <em>Someone</em> has to maintain software that can open those old formats. But for many apps like Delta Chat, I don&#39;t think there&#39;ll be any point supporting obsolete features.</p>

<p>Wow, that was quite a braindump. Hopefully I&#39;ll be able to sleep better now that&#39;s all out :)</p>

<p>Thanks for reading!</p>
