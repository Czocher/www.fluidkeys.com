    <h1>Week 19: Onboarding</h1>
    <p><strong>Protecting liberty by simplifying security</strong></p>

<p><em>Recap</em>: With Fluidkeys, you can send end-to-end encrypted secrets from the command-line, with all the power of OpenPGP and none of the hassle.</p>

<p>Using Fluidkeys reduces the impact of third-party data breaches, targeted spearphishing attacks and network compromise.</p>

<h2>The short version:</h2>

<ul>
<li>We published an intermediate <code>0.2.6</code> release</li>
<li>Licensed our code as AGPLv3</li>
<li>Started designing the onboarding experience</li>
<li>Mocked up a chatbot interface</li>
<li>Took more calls</li>
</ul>

<h2>Quietly released Fluidkeys 0.2.6</h2>

<p>We were keen to put <code>fk secret send</code> into the world so people can try it out without having to build from source. After a lot of bug bashing and tweaking we released <code>0.2.6</code>, which is now available through the normal <a href="https://download.fluidkeys.com">install channels.</a></p>

<p>We only count <code>0.3</code>, <code>0.4</code> as <em>proper</em> releases so this doesn&#39;t count towards our <a href="https://fluidkeys-dashboard.herokuapp.com">metrics</a>, but it&#39;s good hygiene to keep releasing.</p>

<h2>Licensed our code as GNU Affero Public License v3</h2>

<p>We think the AGPL is a good choice: it sends a strong signal that we&#39;re committed to software freedom, while giving us good options for building a service business model.</p>

<h2>Started designing the onboarding experience</h2>

<p>For our upcoming <code>0.3</code> release we realised we need to be better at guiding new users. For people who aren&#39;t that familiar with PGP, it&#39;s not obvious what Fluidkeys <em>is</em>, and staring at <code>fk --help</code> doesn&#39;t answer that either.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve been mocking up a few ways of onboarding new people: helping them to discover what Fluidkeys can do by creating a key and actually <em>doing</em> something with it.</p>

<p>Now that we&#39;ve got <code>fk secret send</code> and <code>fk secret receive</code> we&#39;re designing the onboarding around that: some sort of bot you can interact with to show that it&#39;s working.</p>

<h2>Mocked up a chatbot interface</h2>

<p>We felt it <em>might</em> work to use a chatbot type interface to get people started.</p>

<p>OK, take a deep breath, and take a look at this mockup:</p>

<p><img src="../../images/2018-12-17-secret-squirrel.png" alt="A cartoon squirrel with a chat bubble" /></p>

<p><a href="https://landbot.io/u/H-112432-MJ5YDOCDSN1Y5SGH/index.html">Play with the live chatbot</a></p>

<p>It was awesome that Ian was able to knock up the mockup in 20 minutes based on some rough docs we came up with.</p>

<p>Ultimately we felt that it comes across a little naff: even if it <em>is</em> a good medium, we can&#39;t help thinking about distasteful chatbots made by uncool supermarkets trying to enact their &quot;millennial strategy&quot;.</p>

<p>Once we saw it in for real and talked it over, we felt it would be better todo onboarding <em>inside</em> Fluidkeys. So we&#39;ve started work on <code>fk setup</code>, which will probably have a chattier feel than the rest of the application.</p>

<p>Until next week!</p>
