    <h1>Week 15: Can you help intro us to infosec people?</h1>
    <p><strong>Protecting liberty by simplifying security</strong></p>

<p><em>Recap</em>: We&#39;re building Fluidkeys to make it easy for teams to implement
great security across their organisations.</p>

<p>I&#39;m on my own this week, Paul&#39;s on his hols...</p>

<h2>This week:</h2>

<h3>1. I went to DEFCON Sheffield ‚ò†Ô∏è</h3>

<p>On Monday evening I went to a regular meetup here in Sheffield for people
interested in information security. Jonny Huxtable talked about some exploits
in Etheruem Smart Contracts that led to millions of dollars being lost.
It&#39;s crazy, the stakes are so high for bugs in code that&#39;s becoming a financial
institution!</p>

<p>Then Neil Richardson showed how simple it is to spoof SMS messages and how
phishing is evolving.</p>

<p>A great night, despite us being locked out of the first venue, and none of the
30 or so security nerds being able to break in!</p>

<h3>2. I&#39;ve been contacting people responsible for security in their companies ‚òéÔ∏è</h3>

<p>Some lovely responses to our week notes, with some sage advice. Thank you, it
means a lot when you take time to offer us some feedback. üôè</p>

<p>The consensus is that it&#39;s almost impossible to be selling too early! So,
this week I&#39;ve been reaching out to speak to various teams and organisations
trying to schedule meetings to learn more about their problems and see if we
can sell them something valuable.</p>

<p>This is where you can help, dear reader:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Please could you introduce me to someone working in information security or
devops in either a finance company or a government department?</strong></p>

<p>Tell that person that we&#39;ve developed software that makes it super easy to
implement PGP, and get great security practices going across the organisation.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>3. I&#39;m starting to build a webserver üë®‚Äçüíª</h3>

<p>Besides that, I&#39;ve also been experimenting with how to get the next part of the
puzzle working: syncing keys across teams. (A reminder: Fluidkeys currently
only maintains your individual keys)</p>

<p>I&#39;ve built a small webserver, with a simple API, again all in Go. It&#39;s connected
to a Postgresql database, where we start to record teams, users and fingerprints.
It&#39;s fun working with HTTP again. I&#39;m beginning to get somewhere, and hopefully
I&#39;ll have something show you next week!</p>

<p>That&#39;s it for this week, see you next Friday!</p>
